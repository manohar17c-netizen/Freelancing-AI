# Freelancing-AI


## Google OAuth end-to-end setup (for this FastAPI app)

1. Create OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console (OAuth client type: Web application).
2. Add your redirect URI exactly (example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/callback/google`).
3. Export environment variables before running the app:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/callback/google"
```

4. Verify app-side config at `GET /auth/config` (all booleans should indicate ready).
5. Click the Google CTA in `/ui` and complete auth. You should be redirected back to `/ui/resume`.

Excellent.

Now you're thinking like someone building a **real AI marketplace system** (like Upwork + LinkedIn + AI matching engine).

Let’s build this properly from scratch.

You want:

> Resume uploaded by freelancer
> Client posts job requirement
> AI matches best candidates automatically
> Database stores everything
> Knowledge base grows over time

This is a **Semantic Matching System**.

---

# 🧠 First: Understand What You're Actually Building

This is NOT just keyword search.

This is:

# 🔥 Semantic Matching Engine

Instead of:

```
Resume contains "React"
Job contains "React"
→ Match
```

We build:

```
Resume: "Built scalable frontend apps using Next.js"
Job: "Need React developer"

AI understands React ≈ Next.js
→ Match
```

That’s intelligence.

# 📦 What Technologies We Use

### Frontend

* Next.js
* Tailwind
* Axios

### Backend

* FastAPI
* PostgreSQL (structured data)
* Vector DB (Chroma / Pinecone)
* Sentence Transformers

---

# 🧱 Step 1 — Database Design

You need 2 types of storage:

### 1️⃣ Structured Database (PostgreSQL)

Store:

Freelancers table:

* id
* name
* email
* skills (JSON)
* experience_years
* resume_text

Jobs table:

* id
* client_name
* job_description
* required_skills
* budget

---

### 2️⃣ Vector Database (For AI Matching)

Stores embeddings of:

* Resume chunks
* Job descriptions

Because AI matching works using vector similarity.

---

# 🧠 Step 2 — How AI Matching Actually Works

Here is the secret:

We convert text into numbers.

Example:

```
"5 years React + Node experience"
→ [0.234, -0.776, 0.981 ...]
```

This is called:

# Embeddings

We generate embeddings using:

* sentence-transformers (free)
* or OpenAI embeddings

---

# 🧠 Why Embeddings?

Because similar meaning texts will have close vectors.

Example:

```
React developer
Frontend engineer using React
```

Vectors will be close in mathematical space.

We compute:

# Cosine Similarity

Closer score = better match.

---

# 🛠 Step-by-Step Build

---

# STEP 1 — Resume Upload API

FastAPI example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import chromadb

app = FastAPI()
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
collection = chroma_client.create_collection("freelancers")

@app.post("/upload-resume")
async def upload_resume(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    content = await file.read()
    text = content.decode("utf-8")

    embedding = model.encode([text])

    collection.add(
        documents=[text],
        embeddings=embedding,
        ids=[file.filename]
    )

    return {"message": "Resume stored successfully"}
```

Now resume is stored in AI memory.

---

# STEP 2 — Job Posting API

```python
@app.post("/post-job")
async def post_job(description: str):

    job_embedding = model.encode([description])

    results = collection.query(
        query_embeddings=job_embedding,
        n_results=5
    )

    return results
```

This returns top 5 most similar resumes.

You now have automatic AI matching.

---

# 🧠 But Wait — Real Systems Need Better Intelligence

Basic embedding similarity is good.

But production-grade system needs:

### 1️⃣ Resume Parsing

Extract:

* Skills
* Years of experience
* Education
* Certifications

You can use:

* spaCy
* Custom NLP
* LLM extraction

---

### 2️⃣ Weighted Matching

Example:

Job requires:

* React (high priority)
* AWS (medium)
* 5 years experience (mandatory)

Your scoring formula:

```
Score = 
0.5 * skill_match +
0.3 * experience_match +
0.2 * semantic_similarity
```

Now you're building real intelligence.

---

# 🧠 Advanced: Hybrid Matching System

Best architecture:

```txt
Step 1: Filter by structured data
        (experience, salary, availability)

Step 2: Use vector similarity
        (semantic meaning)

Step 3: Re-rank with LLM
        (final intelligent reasoning)
```

This is how enterprise AI hiring tools work.

---

# 🏢 Real-World Companies Using Similar Systems

* LinkedIn (Recruiter AI)
* Indeed (Candidate matching)
* Upwork (Talent recommendations)
* HireVue (AI hiring intelligence)

---

# 🧠 Knowledge Base Concept

When you say:

> “Create a knowledge base”

You mean:

* Store resumes long-term
* Store job postings
* Learn patterns over time
* Improve matching accuracy

You can improve system by:

### 1️⃣ Storing successful matches

### 2️⃣ Tracking hire outcomes

### 3️⃣ Training ranking model later

This becomes:

# Recommendation Engine

Similar to Netflix recommendations — but for hiring.

---

# 🗄 Database Layout (Professional Version)

PostgreSQL:

Tables:

* users
* freelancers
* resumes
* jobs
* matches
* hire_outcomes

Vector DB:

* resume_embeddings
* job_embeddings

---

# 🔥 Scaling Considerations

When you grow:

* Move vector DB to Pinecone
* Use Redis cache
* Use background queue (Celery)
* Add async processing
* Add authentication (JWT)

---

# 🧠 The Most Important Concept

This system is not “AI magic.”

It is:

* Good data structuring
* Smart embeddings
* Proper ranking logic
* Continuous learning from outcomes

---

# 🎯 What You Just Designed

You designed:

An AI-powered hiring marketplace.

That’s a startup-level idea.

---

Now I need to know your level:

Are you:

* 🟢 Beginner (need full codebase structure from zero)
* 🟡 Intermediate (understand backend already)
* 🔵 Advanced (want scalable architecture design)

Tell me your level, and I’ll build the next step exactly for you.

## Quick setup, run, and test

### macOS / Linux / Windows (single script)

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This single shell script uses OS `if` branches internally to:
1. Create `.venv`
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the FastAPI app on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
4. Run automated API tests (`backend/scripts/test_api.py`)
5. Stop the server

### React frontend setup

The UI is now a React app under `frontend/` and is served by FastAPI from `/ui` after build.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
uvicorn main:app --app-dir backend/scripts --reload --port 8000
```

Open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui` for the React UI
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for API docs

For React dev mode (Vite + FastAPI):

```bash
# terminal 1
uvicorn main:app --app-dir backend/scripts --reload --port 8000

# terminal 2
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
